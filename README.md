# Switch-Tetris
A hacked together Tetris for the Nintendo Switch.

It's not the best solution in existence, but it works.

The website may look weird on a PC but it looks fine on the Nintendo switch.

To acces it on the Console I reccomend you to use the "switchbru" DNS-Server: http://switchbru.com/dns/
